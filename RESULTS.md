# PulseAI Experimental Results

## Hardware Tested
CPU Backend (Codespaces Environment)

## Workload
Transformer Text Generation (DistilGPT2)

## Results

| Run | Throughput | Efficiency | Stability |
|----|----|----|----|
| Run 1 | 53.95 tok/s | 0.845 | 0.94 |
| Run 2 | 55.16 tok/s | 0.908 | 0.98 |

## PulseAI Recommendation
CPU backend provides highest sustainability efficiency.

## Insight
PulseAI identifies optimal hardware execution mode
based on energy-per-token efficiency rather than raw speed.
